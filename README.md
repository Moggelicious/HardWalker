I'm making a pedometer app, and While I don't know anything about how to do it I'm going 
try to implement the basics first and then add more functions. 

2017-07-20:
Added 2 classes, steplistener that listens to steps, and Sensorfilter that filters away nonsteps.

2017-07-26:
Added class Stepdetector that makes the steps in the app, updated the MainActivity with startbutton and stopbutton that
and the activity_main.

I got a basic app that makes steps when you walk and shows it the phone , but this is just the beginning as I had help from:
http://www.gadgetsaint.com/android/create-pedometer-step-counter-android/#.WXjqHbpuKUl (by Anu S Pillai)
as I have never done this before. So now I have the basic code with a functioning app. Next step is to polish the basics
and then starting to add my own code! =)
